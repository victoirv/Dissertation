\abstractpage


The behavior of plasma near Earth's geosynchronous orbit is of vital importance to both satellite operators and magnetosphere modelers because it also has a significant influence on energy transport, ion composition, and induced currents. The system is highly complex in both time and space, making the forecasting of extreme space weather events difficult. This dissertation examines the behavior and statistical properties of plasma mass density near geosynchronous orbit (\req) by using both linear and nonlinear models, as well as epoch analyses, in an attempt to better understand the physical processes that precipitates and drives its variations. 

It is shown that while \req did not vary significantly on an hourly timescale when a drop in the disturbance time scale index (\dst) was observed, it does vary significantly between the day of a \dst event onset and the day immediately following. It is also shown that increases in \req\ were not, on average, preceded or followed by any significant change in the examined solar wind or geomagnetic variables, including \dst, despite prior results that considered a few selected events and found notable influence.

It is verified that \req\ and and solar activity (\f) have a strong correlation, which is stronger over longer timescales such as 27 days than it is over an hourly timescale. It is then shown that this connection seems to affect the behavior of \req\ most during periods of strong solar activity leading to large \req\ reactions to \dst\ drops for high values of \f.  It is also shown that \req\ behaved significantly different before and after events based on the value of \f\ at the onset of a \req\ event or a \dst\ event, and that a southward interplanetary magnetic field at onset led slowed \req\ growth afterwards. These behavioral differences provide insight into how solar and geomagnetic conditions impact mass density at geosynchronous orbit, enabling operators to better anticipate the response to space weather events and magnetosphere models to include mass density effects in their simulation.

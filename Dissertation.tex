\abstractpage

This dissertation intends to first: be a survey of current forecasting capabilities of statistical and  magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) methods of Earth's magnetosphere, and second: attempt to improve upon forecasting methods by investigating the usefulness of various new models on both real and modeled data. The forecasting will be separated into two parts: that focusing on rare, but significant events (e.g. geomagnetic storms), and that focusing on general day-to-day predictions. It will encompass three main methods of forecasting: impulse response functions (IRF), nonlinear methods, and statistical methods that attempt to forecast MHD.

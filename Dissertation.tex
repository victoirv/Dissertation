%% Abstract

\abstractpage

This dissertation intends to first: be a survey of current forecasting capabilities of statistical methods of Earth's plasmatrough, and second: attempt to improve upon forecasting methods by investigating the behavior of equatorial plasma mass density under geomagnetically enhanced conditions. The statistical forecasting models focus on significant geomagnetic events and the predictability thereof using solar wind and magnetospheric drivers, while the behavioral aspect focuses on epoch analyses and observing non-linear effects via binning. It verifies and extends the work of previous studies on the enhancement of equatorial plasma mass density during geomagnetically active times, and the causes of such an enhancement.

\section{A Section}

A DECLARATION OF RIGHTS made by the Representatives of the good people of VIRGINIA, assembled in full and free
Convention; which rights do pertain to them and their posterity, as the basis and foundation of Government.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item That all men are by nature equally free and independent, and have certain
    inherent rights, of which, when they enter into a state of society, they cannot, by any compact, deprive
    or divest their posterity; namely, the enjoyment of life and liberty, with the means of acquiring and
    possessing property, and pursuing and obtaining happiness and safety.

  \item That all power is vested in, and consequently derived from, the people; that magistrates are their trustees
    and servants, and at all times amenable to them.

  \item That government is, or ought to be, instituted for the common benefit, protection, and security of the people,
    nation or community; of all the various modes and forms of government that is best, which is capable of
    producing the greatest degree of happiness and safety and is most effectually secured against the danger
    of maladministration; and that, whenever any government shall be found inadequate or contrary to these
    purposes, a majority of the community hath an indubitable, unalienable, and indefeasible right to reform,
    alter or abolish it, in such manner as shall be judged most conducive to the public weal.

  \item That no man, or set of men, are entitled to exclusive or separate emoluments or privileges from the community,
    but in consideration of public services; which, not being descendible, neither ought the offices of magistrate,
    legislator, or judge be hereditary.

  \item That the legislative and executive powers of the state should be separate and distinct from the judicative;
    and, that the members of the two first may be restrained from oppression by feeling and participating the
    burthens of the people, they should, at fixed periods, be reduced to a private station, return into that body
    from which they were originally taken, and the vacancies be supplied by frequent, certain, and regular elections
    in which all, or any part of the former members, to be again eligible, or ineligible, as the laws shall direct.
\end{enumerate}
